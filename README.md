The title of this paper is Factors Leading to Divorce In Canada. In this project, we will talk about the different factors which will lead to divorce. So, we use R studio to analyze the data of GSS (General Social Survey) Families Cycles 31 from CHASS to introduce the four main reasons of divorce: education level, age & gender, children and personal income. The number of variables of the raw data is huge, we need to choose the meaningful ones to analyze and remove some handicap information. This set of data only includes residents of 10 Canadian provinces and is not representative of everyone. But we will list the main factors that lead to divorce. We hope this report can help alleviate the phenomenon of divorce as much as possible, and hope that every family could be complete and satisfied. 
This project includes a rmd file, a pdf file and some csv files (the csv files describe the data we used) which the rmd file needs to install a R studio to open.
